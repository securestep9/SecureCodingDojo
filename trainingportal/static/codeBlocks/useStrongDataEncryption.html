       "When there is a need to <mark>store</mark> or <mark>transmit</mark> sensitive data, use strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to encrypt that data.

        Do not develop custom or private cryptographic algorithms. They will likely be exposed to attacks that are well-understood by cryptographers. 
        Reverse engineering techniques are mature. If the algorithm can be compromised if attackers find out how it works, then it is especially weak.
        Periodically ensure that the cryptography has not become obsolete. Some older algorithms, once thought to require a billion years of computing time, can now be broken in days or hours. 
        This includes MD4, MD5, SHA1, DES, and other algorithms that were once regarded as strong."</i>

<h5>Encryption of data at rest</h5>
<p>
Sensitive data stored locally should be encrypted to prevent both against physical theft and data leakage attacks. Sensitive data includes but not limited to: personally identifiable information (PII),
passwords, confidential business information.
</p>
<p>
The industry standard is to consider all passwords and encryption keys sensitive data. 
User passwords should stored irreversible and be hashed using a salted adaptive algorithm. 
</p>
<p>
System passwords such as passwords to a database or LDAP server should be encrypted with a strong cryptographic algorithm and using a dynamically generated key or a key obtained from a Hardware Security Module.
Same approach should be taken for other data such as PII or confidential information.

<h5>Encryption of data in transit</h5>
<p>
It has become an industry standard to secure all communications. It is considered a vulnerability to send data in clear text (like in the case of the http:// urls). Other vulnerabilities
include using flawed protocols or ciphers in the communication.

It is also a vulnerability to ignore invalid server certificates.

Here is a list of the few notable vulnerablity disclosures in SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers over the past few years.

        <tr>
            <th>Bacronym</th>
            <th>Vulnerable Protocol or Cipher</th>

Protocol and cipher issues are addressed in the server configuration and the configuration of communication clients.

The public site <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">SSLLabs</a> allows users to test any public server for secure communication issues.
