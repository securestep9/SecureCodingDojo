    The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the MITRE Top 25 programming flaw: "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type".
  <blockquote>
    <p>
         <i>The software allows the attacker to upload or transfer files of dangerous types 
           that can be automatically processed within the product's environment.</i>

<p>To prevent the Cross-Site Request forgery demonstrated in the previous challenge, as well as the inclusion of files from untrusted domains, 
  the developers are now only allowing users to <mark>upload</mark> avatars.
</p>
<p>
    They are restricting the file types to SVG as shown in the code below. 
    They are then saving the files on the system and loading them into the page via &lt;img&gt; references. Do you see any problem with that?
    Upload a file that could be used to execute code if it got uploaded to the Web directory of a Java web application. Like in this case the
    <mark>WebContent/public/</mark> directory.
</p>
<p><strong>Tip: </strong>You need to upload some "server pages".</p>
