<p>
    The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate the #2 MITRE Top 25 programming flaw:
    <strong>Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')</strong>
    <blockquote>
         <i>The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, 
           but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command 
           when it is sent to a downstream component.</i>

        </blockquote>

    The following two other Top 25 weaknesses are related two Command Injection since they usually require some ability to 
    execute arbitrary commands in order to be exploitable.
    However if these issues exist they amplify the magnitude of the problem.
    <ul>
      <li>Execution with Unnecessary Privileges</li>
      <blockquote>
         <i>The software performs an operation at a privilege level that is higher than the minimum level required, 
           which creates new weaknesses or amplifies the consequences of other weaknesses.</i>

      </blockquote>
      <li>Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource</li>
      <blockquote>
         <i>The software specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows 
           that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.</i>

<h4>About the Flaws</h4>
<p>OS command injection happens when the software executes a command line passing in unsanitized user input as command line arguments.
</p>
<p>An attacker can add to the command executed through <mark>injection</mark> techniques, such as piping the output of the original command into another command
  <mark>ping host.com</mark><code>|cat /etc/shadow</code>
</p>
<p>If the program is running with <strong>root</strong> privileges then it will output the contents of the shadow file and 
potentially expose the root password. In that case the "Execution with Unnecessary Privileges" of the program as root would make the problem worse.
In fact if that was the case the attacker wouldn't even need to obtain the shadow file since they could pipe in a command to change the root password.</p>
<p>If the program was running with limited privileges but it had write access to a critical file such as <code>/etc/sudoers</code> then it could add itself
there and change root's password with sudo. In that case the "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource" would make the problem worse.</p>

<h4>About the Challenge</h4>
<p>
  In one of the previous challenges you were able to login in the admin's account and change the address of the updates server. 
  That functionality has been enhanced to perform a connectivity check, in order to avoid mistakes when doing setting changes.
</p>
<p>
  Rather than implementing the check in Java the developers are 'shelling out' and calling the ping command. 
  They put in some sort of input validation/sanitization to prevent addition of commands other than ping. See if you can bypass it.

</p>
<p>
  Your task is to get the contents of the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file. You can use either the <mark>cat</mark> or the <mark>less</mark> command to do so.
</p>
<p>
  Here is the application code. See if you can spot the problem.
</p>
<pre class="pre-scrollable">
	updateServer = request.getParameter("updateServer");
	if(updateServer!=null){
		updateServer = updateServer.replace("'","").replace("\"","").replace("`", "").replace("&amp;", "").replace("|", "");
		boolean isValidServer = Util.isValidServerName(updateServer);
		String output = null;
		if(isValidServer){
			//ping the update server
			String [] commandArgs = {"/bin/sh", "-c", String.format("ping -c 4 %s",updateServer)};
			output = Util.exec(commandArgs);
		}
</pre>
